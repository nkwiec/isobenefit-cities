# Isobenefit Urbanism
The visualisation of evolutionary scenarios through the urban morphogenesis model helps to understand the possible scenarios of urban growth and allows for the analysis of developments of patterns and trends. 

Altered from Dr. Luca D’Acci and Dr. Michele Voto’s code: Isobenefit urbanism model and The Code for the model [git](https://lucadacci.wixsite.com/dacci/isobenefit-urbanism-morphogenesis), I have improved the performance by changing the strategy from iterating over every cell of the simulated universe on which there are performed computationally expensive operations O(N^2) resulting in O(N^4) overall computational cost, to the strategy where we iterate over the cells which are potential new neighbours of the existing building. The central points which don’t necessarily spawn of existing buildings are generated by drawing the number of new central points from a binomial distribution (which is usually a very small number) only to randomly select their new location (the cost of this new approach is probabilistically O(N).

By reproducing the code to a web verison, it allowed it to be more accessible to a wider audience. This version does not require the user to have set up a python environment, making it ready to use.
Currently, this is only a work in progress, aiming to present the concept for a more interactive version. By successfully speeding up the simulation (which has been deliberately slowed down in the web animation to present how the cells expand), it opens up the possibility of introducing panels for adjusting parameters for the user to interact with. Without this speeding up, this wouldn’t be possible due to the time taken to compute a single iteration.

The urban morphogenesis model acts as a catalyst for applying change and we would be able to visualise what needs to be done to address these issues such as sustainability and well-being, while considering existing market dynamics and policy restrictions. By making it available faster, and to a wider audience it might potentially open up collaborative ideas from other areas, therefore addressing urban issues with more diversity and consideration.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and python installed, if don't have it on your machine already, the [anaconda distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) is the easiest place to start.


### Install
Open the terminal (On Windows search for `Anaconda Prompt`)
Navigate to the directory where you want to install the package and then clone the repository to the local folder of your choice via
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitochevole/isobenefit-cities.git
```

If you are using anaconda, create a new environment:
```bash
conda create --name [my_env] python=3.6
```

activate the environment typing `conda activate [my_env]`
navigate inside the project directory 
```bash
cd isobenefit-cities
```

then run `make install`
On windows if the `make` command is not available, run instead
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

## Run the simulations

![GUI interface](gui-interface-example.png?raw=true)

Running `make run-gui` opens a `tk-inter`-based GUI 
where you can: 
- choose the type of development
- set the size of the map both in X and Y direction in number of cells
- set the maximum number of iterations for the simulation
- set the maximum population that the simulation will reach
- set the maximum population density
- set the probability of building a new urban block (provided that all other conditions for constructions are satisfied)
- set the probability P1 of creating a new centrality adjacent to constructed areas
- set the probability P2 of creating a new isolated centrality
- set the size in units of simulation cells of the critical distance T*
- random seed for the simulation

If again `make` is not available just run:
```bash
python scripts/tkinter-gui-interface.py
```


You can also run the simulations directly fom command line.
```bash
 python run-isobenefit-simulation.py --size-x 69 --size-y 100 --n-steps 20 --initialization-mode image --input-filepath initial_config_1.png
 python run-isobenefit-simulation.py --size-x 69 --size-y 100 --n-steps 20 --initialization-mode list --build-probability 0.3 --neighboring-centrality-probability 0.01 --isolated-centrality-probability 0.05

```

When you run the simulation, it will create a folder at `[current_directory]/simulations/yyyymmdd-hhMMss`
where `yyyymmdd-hhMMss` is the timestamp at which the simulation is run.

Inside the folder are stored:
- a png snapshot of the simulated scenario at each step of the iteration
- `metadata.json` file with the parameters of the simulation
- `current_counts.csv` a comma separated text file storing the per-step and cumulative counts of population increase and built blocks and centralities for each step of the iteration

## Technical details
The value T* sets the scale for the simulation. 
In the literature (citation needed) the critical value T* refers to the distance that can be covered in 15 minutes on foot.
If we assume that a human can walk at a pace of 4 km/h then the distance T* is roughly one km.

Setting `T* = x cells` means that we are giving to each square cell a side of 1000/x metres.

This is then used to compute the population to be associated with each cell.

In the isboenefit scenario a cell can be densely populated ( having max density)
or moderately populated (having max density/10 ).

In the classical scenario cells can also be scarcely populated, having a density of max density/100. 


## Aknowledgments

This repository gets its inspiration and it's driven by the work of [Luca D'Acci](https://sites.google.com/view/lucadacci).

The code benefits of the comments and fruitful discussions with [Stefano Ugliano](https://about.me/stefanougliano).
